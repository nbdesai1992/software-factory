# Software Factory

**Prompt to production.** A Claude Code orchestration toolkit with pre-built skills, worker agents, and deployment configs that turns a product description into deployed, tested software — autonomously.

```
/spec create "build an invoice tracker for freelancers"
/goal <the prompt the spec skill hands you>
```

That's it. The factory handles decomposition, coding, testing, visual design, and deployment across backend, frontend, and infrastructure — with you in the loop only when it matters.

## How It Works

```
  You describe it           The factory builds it              You push to deploy

  "Build a..."   ──►  Brief ──► 2-active/ ──► 4-done/   ──►   Deployed on Render
                  (backlog)         │              or
                                    │          3-blocked/  ←  needs YOUR answer
                              /goal keeps it
                              running; workers
                              execute subtasks
```

1. **Onboard** — Run the setup wizard, pointed at a project directory (existing or not). Answer a few questions about your stack. The factory creates the repo, installs skills, agents, hooks, and the brief board, and pushes it to GitHub.
2. **Spec** — Describe what you want. The spec skill interviews you and produces a **goal brief**: a self-contained card on the `briefs/` Kanban board with requirements, acceptance criteria, and an embedded execution protocol — plus a ready-to-paste `/goal` prompt.
3. **Run** — Paste the `/goal` prompt. Claude Code keeps running turns until the brief reaches a terminal folder; each turn the runner delegates subtasks to specialized worker subagents, updates the brief, and proves board state. Human blockers are parked while everything else continues — the brief only lands in `3-blocked/` when nothing runnable remains.
4. **Deploy** — Infrastructure-first workflow. Backend deploys and tests against a real database before frontend work begins. You `git push` when ready — Render auto-deploys.

## What's In The Box

### Pre-Built Skills

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **orchestrate** | Board runner — selects the next brief, decomposes it into subtasks, delegates to worker subagents, verifies acceptance, routes to done or blocked |
| **spec** | Interactive requirements gathering — interviews you, produces goal briefs with acceptance criteria and their `/goal` prompts |
| **bold-design** | Fights generic AI aesthetics. Enforces domain-specific design: distinctive typography, color from the product's world, signature visual elements |
| **verify-ui** | Autonomous screenshot loop — takes screenshots via dev-browser, analyzes against requirements, iterates until the UI is right |
| **backend-test** | Test-driven backend development against real databases. No mocks, no SQLite substitutes |
| **deploy** | Full Render operations — CLI commands, API reference, blueprint schema, debugging playbooks |
| **worker-protocol** | Shared conventions for all worker subagents — read/write boundaries, blocker escalation, interface contracts, structured final reports |
| **status** | Board diagnostics — progress, blockers, requirement coverage, trajectory audit trail |

### Worker Agents

| Agent | Skills | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **backend-worker** | worker-protocol, backend-test | Models, migrations, API endpoints — tested against real cloud DB |
| **frontend-worker** | worker-protocol, bold-design, verify-ui | UI development with domain-specific design and visual verification |
| **infra-worker** | worker-protocol, deploy | Service provisioning, deployments, health verification |

### Generated Configs

Every onboarded project gets:

```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md               # Project context: stack, design direction, deployed URLs
├── render.yaml             # Render blueprint (monorepo: backend/ + frontend/)
├── briefs/                 # The brief board (committed): 1-backlog/ 2-active/
│                           #   3-blocked/ 4-done/ — folder location IS status
└── .claude/
    ├── settings.json       # Permissions + hooks wiring
    ├── hooks/              # brief-progress-guard (enforced docs) + trajectory-log
    ├── agents/             # 3 worker subagent definitions
    └── skills/             # 8 skills (orchestration + development + deployment)
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Clone the factory (once)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nbdesai1992/software-factory.git
```

Keep this somewhere permanent. It's the source — you'll point it at each new project.

### Step 2: Onboard a new project

```bash
python /path/to/software-factory/onboard.py ~/code/my-new-app
```

The directory doesn't need to exist — the wizard offers to create it. It asks about your stack (Next.js? FastAPI? PostgreSQL? Render?) and installs everything: 8 skills, 3 worker agents, CLAUDE.md, render.yaml, settings.json, hooks, and skeleton `backend/` + `frontend/` apps. Then it runs `git init` and — if the `gh` CLI is authenticated — offers to create the GitHub repo, commit, and push. Point it at an existing clone instead and it leaves your repo and remote untouched.

### Step 3: Set up Render (one-time)

```bash
brew install render && render login
```

Then in the Render Dashboard: **Blueprints → New Blueprint Instance → select your repo.** Render reads `render.yaml` and creates your services + database. First deploy will fail (no code yet) — that's expected.

### Step 4: Build

```bash
claude   # Open Claude Code in your project

# Inside Claude Code:
/spec create "build an invoice tracker for freelancers"
# Answer a few questions about features, scope, constraints...
# The spec skill writes the brief and hands you a /goal prompt — paste it:
/goal Brief 001-invoice-tracker ... is in a terminal folder ...
# The factory takes over: infra → backend → frontend → deploy, turn after turn
/status
# Check the board at any time
```

The runner provisions infrastructure, writes backend code tested against your real Render database, builds the frontend wired to the deployed API, and parks anything that needs you (like `git push` to deploy) as a blocker while it finishes everything else. When the brief leaves `2-active/` it lands in exactly one of two places: `4-done/` (complete) or `3-blocked/` (NEEDS HUMAN INTERVENTION — answer the brief's `Resolution:` lines and run `/orchestrate` to resume). Prefer manual control? Skip `/goal` and run `/orchestrate` one turn at a time.

## Architecture

```
          /spec create "..."
                │
                ▼
          ┌───────────┐   Goal brief in briefs/1-backlog/ + /goal prompt
          │   BRIEF    │   (requirements, acceptance criteria, embedded
          └─────┬─────┘    execution protocol, task breakdown, progress log)
                │
          /goal ... (or /orchestrate per turn)
                │
                ▼                        ┌── after each turn, a checker model

  Real DB    Screenshots   Render          Terminal: briefs/4-done/  (complete)
  on Render  + iteration   auto-deploy         or briefs/3-blocked/  (needs human)
```

**Infrastructure-first:** Cloud services are provisioned first. Backend develops and tests against the real Render database. Frontend wires to the deployed API. You `git push` to deploy — a natural checkpoint for code review.

**Sequential delegation:** The runner executes subtasks one at a time via native subagents (Task tool). Each worker gets fresh context with its role's skills preloaded, returns a structured report, and the runner records results in the brief.

**Harness-enforced, not remembered:** `/goal` enforces the loop (an independent checker model decides completion), a Stop hook enforces per-turn progress documentation in the brief, and a PostToolUse hook writes a deterministic trajectory log for evals. A generous turn cap in the goal is the only backstop — long-running is fine, infinite is not.

**Resumable by design:** The brief carries all state. Close Claude Code mid-run, reopen, run `/orchestrate` — it reads the board and picks up exactly where it left off.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/spec create "goal"` | Interview → goal brief in `1-backlog/` + ready-to-paste `/goal` prompt |
| `/spec update {id}` | Modify a brief's requirements (active briefs re-plan next turn) |
| `/spec show` | Render the board; add a brief ID for its full detail |
| `/goal <generated prompt>` | Autonomous: run turns until the brief reaches `4-done/` or `3-blocked/` |
| `/orchestrate` | Run the board one turn manually (also resumes blocked briefs after you answer) |
| `/status` | Board summary |
| `/status detail` | Active brief's full task breakdown |
| `/status blockers` | Open questions needing your input |
| `/status requirements` | Requirement → subtask coverage map |

## Deploy Platform

**V1:** Render — full adapter with CLI reference, API docs, blueprint schema, pricing guide, and starter `render.yaml` generation (monorepo with `rootDir` per service).

**Future:** Vercel, Fly.io. To add a platform: `factory/templates/skills/deploy/{platform}/SKILL.md.tpl`.

## Human In The Loop

The system is autonomous but pauses for you when it matters:

| When | What You Do | Time |
|------|------------|------|
| Push to deploy | Review code, `git push` | 1-2 min |
| Missing API keys | Set env vars in Render Dashboard | 5 min |
| Brief lands in `3-blocked/` | Answer the `Resolution:` lines in the brief, run `/orchestrate` | 1-5 min |
| Design review (optional) | Check `session/design-direction.md` | 5 min |

A brief in `3-blocked/` means the runner did everything it could and what remains needs you — it is a distinct terminal state, never reported as "done."

## Re-Onboarding

```bash
python /path/to/software-factory/onboard.py --reconfigure
```

Re-reads saved config, lets you change settings, re-generates all files.
