# Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions for creating a new project with Software Factory.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) installed
- [Render CLI](https://docs.render.com/cli) installed: `brew install render`
- Render CLI authenticated: `render login`
- GitHub account with push access

Verify Render is ready:
```bash
render workspace current -o json
```

## Step 1: Run the Factory Onboarding

Point the onboarding script at a project directory. It does not have to exist yet — you'll be asked whether to create it:

```bash
python /path/to/software-factory/onboard.py ~/code/your-project
```

The wizard asks about your project (name, description, domain, design direction, tech stack, deployment platform) and installs everything:

- `backend/` — Skeleton FastAPI app with `/health` endpoint
- `frontend/` — Skeleton Next.js app with `/api/health` route
- `.claude/skills/` — 8 pre-built skills (orchestration, testing, design, deployment, etc.)
- `.claude/agents/` — 3 worker agent definitions (backend, frontend, infra)
- `.claude/settings.json` — Permissions for headless worker sessions
- `CLAUDE.md` — Project context, architecture, deployed URLs
- `render.yaml` — Render blueprint defining your services + database
- `.gitignore` — Updated with `session/`, `.env`

Finally it sets up git: `git init`, then — if the `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated — offers to create a GitHub repo, wire it up as `origin`, commit the setup, and push. Decline any of these and it prints the command to run yourself. Render's GitHub integration detects `render.yaml` as soon as the push lands.

Already have a repo cloned? Just run `python /path/to/software-factory/onboard.py` from inside it — the existing git repo and remote are left alone.

## Step 2: Create Env Group + Blueprint Instance

### 2a: Create shared env group (one-time per workspace)

If you don't already have a `general_builder_keys` env group in your Render workspace:

1. Render Dashboard → **Env Groups** → **New Environment Group**
2. Name it `general_builder_keys` (or whatever you specified during onboarding)
3. Add your shared API keys (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)

The `render.yaml` references this group via `fromGroup` — all services will automatically receive these keys when the blueprint is applied.

### 2b: Create Clerk application (if auth is configured)

If you chose Clerk during onboarding:

1. Go to [clerk.com](https://clerk.com) → sign in → **Create Application**
2. Name it after your project
3. Copy the **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**
4. In the Render Dashboard, set these env vars on your services:
   - Frontend: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` = your publishable key
   - Frontend: `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` = your secret key
   - Backend: `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` = your secret key

These are declared as `sync: false` in render.yaml — you set the values manually.

### 2c: Apply Blueprint Instance

This is a one-time manual step. Render does not support creating Blueprint Instances via API or CLI — it must be done in the Dashboard.

1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. **Select the correct workspace** (not a shared/team workspace unless intended)
3. **Blueprints** → **New Blueprint Instance**
4. Select your GitHub repo and the branch you're deploying from (e.g., `develop` or `main`)
5. Render reads `render.yaml` and creates:
   - `{your-project}-api` (backend web service, Python/FastAPI)
   - `{your-project}-frontend` (frontend web service, Node/Next.js)
   - `{your-project}-db` (PostgreSQL database)
   - Links the shared env group to both services
   - Sets cross-service URLs (`API_URL` on frontend, `FRONTEND_URL` + `CORS_ORIGINS` on backend)
6. First deploy will build and deploy the skeleton apps. Both `/health` endpoints should return `{"status": "ok"}`.

**Important:** The infra-worker will never create services via API. It only verifies that services exist (created by you here) and uses them for deployments, logs, and health checks. If you skip this step, the orchestrator will raise a blocker asking you to do it.

## Step 3: Open Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

Open Claude Code in your project directory. It will load CLAUDE.md and all the installed skills.

## Step 4: Create a Goal Brief

```
/spec create "describe what you want to build"
```

The spec skill interviews you about features, scope, constraints, and success criteria, then writes a goal brief to `briefs/1-backlog/` and hands you a ready-to-paste `/goal` prompt. Review and approve the brief.

## Step 5: Run It

Paste the `/goal` prompt the spec skill gave you — Claude Code keeps running turns until the brief reaches a terminal folder (`briefs/4-done/` complete, or `briefs/3-blocked/` needs your input). Or run one turn at a time:

```
/orchestrate
```

Either way, the runner takes over:

1. **Infrastructure** — Verifies Render services exist, pulls DB credentials into `backend/.env`
2. **Backend** — Writes models, migrations, API endpoints, tests against real Render DB
3. **Deploy backend** — Commits code, asks you to `git push` (your review checkpoint). Render auto-deploys.
4. **Frontend** — Writes UI with domain-specific design, wired to deployed backend API
5. **Deploy frontend** — Commits code, asks you to `git push`. Render auto-deploys.
6. **Verify** — Screenshots the deployed site, checks against requirements

## Step 6: Check Progress

At any time:

```
/status              # Board summary
/status detail       # Active brief's full task breakdown
/status blockers     # What needs your input
/status requirements # Requirement → subtask coverage
```

## When the System Needs You

The runner parks anything that needs a human and keeps working on everything else. When nothing runnable remains, the brief moves to `briefs/3-blocked/` and the runner announces **NEEDS HUMAN INTERVENTION** — a distinct terminal from done, never reported as success.

| When | What to do |
|------|-----------|
| **Push to deploy** | Review the diff, run `git push` (Render auto-deploys on commit) |
| **Missing env var** | Set it in Render Dashboard |
| **Unclear requirement / decision needed** | Open the blocked brief, write your answer on the blocker's `Resolution:` line |
| **Design review** (optional) | Check `session/design-direction.md` after first frontend task |

After answering, run `/orchestrate` — the brief moves back to `2-active/` and work resumes with your answers applied.

## Re-Onboarding

To change your project's configuration later:

```bash
python /path/to/software-factory/onboard.py --reconfigure
```

## Diagnostic: Trajectory

Each brief gets `session/{brief-id}/trajectory.md` — the curated agentic trace written by the runner and workers — plus `session/{brief-id}/trajectory.jsonl`, a deterministic machine-parseable log written automatically by a PostToolUse hook for every subagent call. Use these for evaluating harness behavior and diagnosing issues.
