# Software Factory

A Claude Code orchestration toolkit that turns a product spec into working software.

## What This Is

This repository contains the generic orchestration system — skills, agents, and templates that can be installed into any project. It is NOT a project itself; it is tooling.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repo
2. From your target project directory: `python /path/to/software-factory/onboard.py`
3. Answer the questions
4. Open Claude Code in your project
5. `/spec create "what you want to build"` — produces a goal brief + a `/goal` prompt
6. Paste the `/goal` prompt (autonomous) or run `/orchestrate` one turn at a time

## Development Guidelines

- Generic skills should contain NO project-specific content
- Templates use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax (simple string replacement, no Jinja2)
- New deploy platform adapters go in `factory/templates/skills/deploy/{platform}/`
- The runner delegates subtasks to native worker subagents (Task tool, one at a time, sequential); agent definitions live in `.claude/agents/` with skills preloaded via their `skills:` frontmatter
- Target projects get a committed `briefs/` Kanban board (1-backlog / 2-active / 3-blocked / 4-done — folder location is status) plus hooks in `.claude/hooks/` that enforce per-turn brief documentation and deterministic trajectory logging
